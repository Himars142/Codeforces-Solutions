# Codeforces Solutions

> **HUGE NOTE:**  
> I rarely comment my solutions, as I'm going for speed when writing these programs (as if I was in competition).  
> You WILL find my variable naming confusing.  
> This is not how I, or anyone, should program in a practical setting.

## Mission in Doing Codeforces

- To learn C++
- To grow better at recognizing algorithms
- To expand my knowledge on unknown algorithms
- To increase my "field of view" on how problems can be solved

## Repository Structure

All solutions are located in the [`solutions/`](solutions) folder.  
Each file is named according to the problem number and letter (e.g., `158A.cpp`).

## Problem Difficulty

In general, the higher you go up in lexicographical order of the suffix letter, the harder the problem.

**Examples:**
- 158B is harder than 158A
- 158B is harder than 1000A
- 1000A is as hard as 158A

## How to Use

1. Browse the [`solutions/`](solutions) directory for the problem you are interested in.
2. Each file contains a standalone solution for a specific Codeforces problem.
3. Copy and paste the code into the Codeforces submission page, or use it for learning/reference.
